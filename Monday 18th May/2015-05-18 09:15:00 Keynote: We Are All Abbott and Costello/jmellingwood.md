* Gotta look up the Magna 6400 User Guide
* Technical writing always demands iteration because it isn't always possible to anticipate the assumptions you are making and the miscommunication that can result.
* It is easy to assume that people know what you mean.  Someone confirming that they understand is not an indication of understanding.
