# jmellingwood's Notes

* No one reads anything on the internet
* "How Users Read on the Web" --Jakob Nielsen
    * They don't; they scan
    * meaningful text and images
    * the beginnings of paragraphs (first 3-5 words)
    * bullet lists
    * variations in typeface (links, bold, etc)
    * code snippets

* 2.25 improvement in retention
* shorter text
* objective POV

## Examples

* readers skip things that look like ads, EVEN IF THEY ARE MEANT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
* text too wide
* maybe optimize for scanning?
* TOC at top of page helps people find what they're looking for
* information sense: move important words to the beginning of the line


* Users are also bad at searching; they just give up
* Duplicate content or headings can be useful for helping customers making extremely different searches
* Mental Models ALL THE SAME THINGS / get this from analytics, etc.
    * helper libraries
    * client sdks
    * api sdks
    * library bindings
    * language-specific wrappers

* Add a bunch of verbs
    * often go to the same page

* No one reads anything above/below code snippets
* Every user failure is a potential job to be done
* make sure your docs are the docs users find
* wikiHow will do it if you don't.  This shouldn't happen.

* edit stack overflow
* put the exact error code within your docs so that it's search friendly

* validation as documentation
    * fix it in the API itself (error messages need to tell people *how* to fix it or where to look)

## DO Notes

* Let's get some good content in DO API error messages
