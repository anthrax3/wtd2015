# jmellingwood's Notes

* scenario-based guides
* not procedural, forget the trivial prereqs
* knows the user
* users level up at the end

* Know your customers well enough to know where they want to go and then take them there

* tutorial for hello world
* scenario-based for where they actually want to go
* get them from beginner-to-intermediate or intermediate-to-advanced

* clarifying goals and what you need
* don't waste time with things they should know
* spend time on cognitive leaps user will need to make to make it real-world relevant


* know your customers, what problems are they trying to solve and what roadblocks are they running into
* develop customer profiles and pitch it to the customer profile
* not exactly a tutorial; not about getting started, what to do after you've gotten started, prove you can do what's on the tin
* simple procedures for a complex process
* links to primary docs, don't waste time on explaining something you don't need to
* videos for illustration, not documentation (supplementary)
* building can be fun!
* Give a Hollywood ending
