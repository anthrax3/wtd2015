# jmellingwood's Notes

* ReadMe.io
    * reduce learning curve
    * a lot of work to get started
    * English is very ambiguous
    * Writing more to destroy ambiguity
    * hahahaha It's not good just because it looks like Stripe's

* separation of duties
    * reference guides - generated
    * examples or tutorials - generated, plus humans to curate and add context
    * topical guides - humans, plus community
    * support - community

* API Ecosystem
    * MVC: Minimum Viable Call
        * Onboarding Flow
            * learn about them
            * installation
            * MVC (very encouraging)
            * next steps (actionable next steps)

* Things that don't seem like documentation but really are
    * interactive playgrounds
    * dashboards
    * error messages
    * API SDKs

* embracing support
    * wild west of the site, just dump stuff in there
