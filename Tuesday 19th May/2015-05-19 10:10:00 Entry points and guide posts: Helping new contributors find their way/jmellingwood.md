# jmellingwood's Notes

* Make it clear what help you need
* Make it clear how to do it
* MDN

## Streamline the path from interest to success

* Old "Getting Started" page
    * Wall of text
    * Contrary to purpose
* New guide...
    * 3 simple steps
    * "create an account", "pick something to work on", "get started"
    * talk about tasks to do
        * "how to do an editorial review"
        * small set of tasks
        * time estimate
        * area of interest categorized
        * link of list of things that need things done to them

## Create invitations, not roadblocks

* When you don't have something, ask people to add it
* things that aren't done are opportunities for people to help you
* Show content that is missing so that people know where they can contribute
* Maybe even provide interface for translations, modifications of existing content

## Expose areas that need help, in what ways

* "Are we documented yet?" overview page of content to flesh out
* document status pages
* alert changes for associated documents (translations get alerts on version changes)
