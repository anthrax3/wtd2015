* the happy secret to better work --TED talk
* happiness inspires productivity

* 3 happiness predictors:
    * optimism: the certainty that you will make a difference and that it'll be recognized and acknowledged
        * top down doesn't work
        * bottom up doesn't scale
    * perception of stress: challenge or threat?
    * connection: support, collaboration, influence
        * is it hard to make a difference?

* Twitter: Creating the Culture of Documentation
* Matthew Lyon â€” Minimum Viable Documentation

* Talk to as many users as you can
* don't exist, hard to find, don't know if reliability
* no time, no incentive, no culture of docs

* Documentation will never be part of engineering culture until it is integrated into the codebase and engineering workflow.

* Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades
    * Enable engineers to find, create, and maintain docs by keeping documentation in a simple portable format (Markdown) next to its associated code
    * g3doc: radically simple documentation
    * focused on the user relentlessly

* Our culture: open, transparent, and generous.  DOn't like the cookie, pass the plate.  Opportunity for impact, governance belongs to the contributors
* Integrated into the core developer infrastructure

* A seat at the table
    * significant support
    * g3doc support integrated into google DNA
    * strong recommendations from teams
    * time with senior engineers

* What's a scrappy startup to do?
    * Stable, reliable platform
    * g3doc is the best documentation platform
    * g3doc Team is Best Team


* Focus on the engineer; take off the writing hat.  Don't expect them to adapt.  You need to adapt.
* Mementum matters.  Start small, iterate often.
* Authority and influence don't derive from your resume but from action and impact
